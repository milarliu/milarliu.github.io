### E-commerce Cross-sell Optimization Strategy – Digital Marketing Analytics with SQL

**[Download SQL code Appendix on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Ecommerce%20Cross-sell%20Project%20SQL%20Appendix.sql)**

> I worked in an eCommerce Database Analyst role for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online retailer, with the goal to work with the CEO, the Marketing Director, and the Website Manager to help steer the business. I analyzed and assisted in optimizing marketing channels, measured and tested website conversion performance, and used data to understand the impact of new product launches. I analyzed the trends of session and order volume growth, efficiency improvements, growth in specific channels, and revenue and margin. I also dived deep into the impact of introducing new products, and extracted insights and recommendations accordingly.

> In this project, the revenue was lifted by $50,000+ by designing cross-sell strategy based on page performance analysis and optimization testing. I conducted customer-level clickstream and web pathing analysis, built conversion funnels for marketing campaigns using MySQL. My analytics results helped drive more traffic to company website.

> I worked in a team of five to perform operation analysis for Aurubis as the capstone project of MS in Business Analytics program. Aurubis is a manufacturing operation which produces copper and brass strip for use in diversified industries. They currently has initiatives to expand their data analytics systems, focused on bringing data together, across different business system platforms, to perform analysis on more big picture, strategic questions for the business. Aurubis uses 'yield' to quantify the percentage of a product's starting weight that is converted into a finished product to be shipped to customers. The project objective is to improve yield, along with improving the accuracy of predicted yield, which will enhance the scheduling efficiency, on-time delivery performance, as well as the potential to lower production cost and inventory on hand.

> Firstly, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) as descriptive study, looking into yield pattern by various features and combinations of features. Secondly, in order to build predictive model, we performed feature engineering process by calculating the aggregated coil-level yield, storing expected features at same level, and getting dummies for operations and machines sequence. Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (light GBM) are three key models we created and focused to evaluate, with light GBM turning out to be the best model with mean absolute error (MAE) lower than 4%.

> With the insights extracted, we drew conclusion and recommendations, including but not limited to better machine allocation, operations to optimize, alloys and width to use, as well as number of slits in producing process. We also constructed a user interface prototype for Aurubis management to assist their data-driven decision-making, where they can input the key features and get the predicted yield using light GBM as output.

### Product Launch Recommendation for EarlyRiders (Toy Horse Manufacturer) - Conjoint Analysis with R

**[View Project Report on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Product%20Launch%20Recommendation%20for%20EarlyRider.pdf)**

**[Download R Markdown Appendix on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Product%20Launch%20Recommendation%20for%20EarlyRider_Code.Rmd)**

> In this academic project, we conducted conjoint analysis for a relatively small toy company, EarlyRiders, that specializes in the manufacture of quality toy riding horses with a particular focus on natural materials. EarlyRiders had a recent management change and realized that their product set was underperforming. They currently offer two products and one in particular was not doing well. The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users. For this purpose, we ran a conjoint analysis, analyzed the data and created a presentation to recommend on new product (set) launch.

> In the conjoint analysis to optimize product launch decision, we executed benefit segmentation (including a-priori and post-hoc) and market simulation. We identified configuration of potential product profiles that gains the most market share, and eventually achieved potential profit uplift amounting to $40,000.

### Pricing Strategy for Iron Mountain (Information Management Services Company) - Business Intelligence with R, Python and Pricefx

**[View Project Report on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Pricing%20Strategy%20for%20Iron%20Mountain.pdf)**

> I worked with four amazing teammates - Andy (Jiangcheng) Lin, Echo (Yuqiao) Zhong, Kaili Tan, and Yuheng Xiong. We were honored to win the first place in this case competition.

> In this case competition project, we analyzed sales data of Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), a global leader for storage and information management services trusted by more than 225,000 organization around the world. A segment of IRM that accounts for approximately $80 million of revenue per year recently acquired several entities. Following the acquisitions, IRM is merging the data into one system in 2020. IRM would like to optimize the Revenue Management Strategy this year. For this purpose, we ran a pricing analysis and gave recommendation to support client's decision making on whether to consolidate the price offerings or continue to offer different pricing by location.

> We analyzed the data on price elasticity and product line; designed customer segmentation focusing on the recent acquisition. Utilizing R, Python and Pricefx (sponsor of the case competition), we visualized the insights. We also developed a profitable pricing strategy for Iron Mountain, and estimated the potential impact of our recommendations.

### Credit Risk Prediction Analysis and Interactive Interface for Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications - Machine Learning with Python

**[View Project Report on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20for%20HELOC.pdf)**

**[View ipynb Notebook Appendix on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20for%20HELOC_Code.ipynb)**

> In this academic project, we developed a predictive model and a decision support system (DSS) that evaluates the risk of HELOC applications. Data provided by FICO Community: https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge. 

> We trained machine learning models (including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Single Decision Tree, Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forest) to evaluate risk of credit card application. To make it user-friendly for sales representatives in a bank or credit card company to decide on accepting or rejecting applications, we designed interactive interface prototype that can be used to optimize decision-making in applicants screening process.

### Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Natural Language Processing with Python

**[View ipynb Notebook Appendix on Github](https://github.com/milarliu/milarliu.github.io/blob/master/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)**

> In this academic project, each row of the dataframe contains a tweet sent by a customer to an airline, most of which are negative. The task is to find out those tweets that are not negative by conducting a NLP analysis to predict the label of each observation.

> I Tokenized and vectorized tweets sent by clients to airlines using TF-DIF and bag-of-words model. By Utilizing Naïve-Bayes algorithm and random forest model, I classified unlabeled tweets, and eventually achieving 75% precision of classification.
